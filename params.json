However, thanks to Ivandavidov's Minimal Linux Live Project (https://github.com/ivandavidov/minimal) that dream is a reality for me. \r\n\r\n![AwlsomeLinux](https://github.com/AwlsomeAlex/AwlsomeLinux/blob/master/AwlsomeLinux.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n## What is AwlsomeLinux?\r\nRight now, AwlsomeLinux is a minimal, almost installable, and text-based Linux Environment (Wouldn't call it a Distro yet...) which has the following features:\r\n* The Latest Long-Term-Support Linux Kernel (4.4.x)\r\n* The Latest Stable BusyBox (1.25.x Stable)\r\n* The Latest Glibc (2.24)\r\n\r\n**Extra Packages Such As:**\r\n* Links 2.13 (Text-Based Web Browser)\r\n* Dropbear 2016.74 (Shell SSH)\r\n* Nano 2.6.3 (Alternative Text Editor)\r\n\r\n## Contributors:\r\n* AwlsomeAlex (Creator of AwlsomeLinux)\r\n* Ivandavidov (Creator of Minimal Linux Live) [AwlsomeLinux is a Fork of it.]\r\n\r\n\r\n",
