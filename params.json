However, thanks to Ivandavidov's Minimal Linux Live Project (https://github.com/ivandavidov/minimal) that dream is a reality for me. \r\n\r\n![AwlsomeLinux Init](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AwlsomeAlex/AwlsomeLinux/master/AwlsomeLinux_dec-06-2016_screenshot.png)\r\n\r\n## History of AwlsomeLinux\r\nWelcome to AwlsomeLinux, a small embedded Linux Distribution that you can \"Mostly\" build yourself. This project started with my interest on how the Linux Kernel works, and how Tiny Core Linux worked, so I decided \"Why not just build it?\" Well, this was last year, and the [Minimal Linux Live Project](https://github.com/ivandavidov/minimal), the project AwlsomeLinux is forked on, was barely off its feet and my goal of a Linux Distribution was further than ever. However recently Ivandavidov put alot of work to the project, and I decided to fork it. AwlsomeLinux wasn't the first thing I had in mind however, the main reason I forked it was due to the project becoming too complex, so I merely simplified it. However I then got the idea \"Why not add to it as well.\" I then implemented Nano and Ncurses, not too difficult, but wasn't 'entirely' accepted. Due to this, I then decided that I would start my own project, thus AwlsomeLinux (AwlsomeAlex Linux). Once this decision was made, I then simplified the scripts even more, to the point where the whole project was three scripts, one folder and one makefile, and after weeks of rewritting, I finally considered myself my own Linux Distribution. For here on out my main goals will be to add more packages, make AwlsomeLinux installable, make AwlsomeLinux self-hosted, and make AwlsomeLinux a GUI/TUI Interface.\r\n\r\n## What is AwlsomeLinux?\r\nRight now, AwlsomeLinux is a minimal, almost installable, and text-based Linux Environment which has the following features:\r\n* The Latest Long-Term-Support Linux Kernel (4.4.x)\r\n* The Latest Stable BusyBox (1.25.x Stable)\r\n* The Latest Glibc (2.24)\r\n* OverlayFS Support (Read-Only for ISO / Read-Write for USB)\r\n\r\n## Dependencies:\r\n* build-essential, wget, make, gawk, gcc, bc, syslinux, genisoimage (Ubuntu-Based Distributions)\r\n* (More Distribution Support Coming Soon!)\r\n\r\n## How to Build:\r\n* 'make all' - Completely Compiles AwlsomeLinux, simple as that!\r\n\r\n## Credits:\r\n* AwlsomeAlex (Creator of AwlsomeLinux)\r\n* Ivandavidov (Creator of Minimal Linux Live) [AwlsomeLinux is based on it.]\r\n\r\n\r\n",
