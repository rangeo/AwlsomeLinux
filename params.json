However, thanks to Ivandavidov's Minimal Linux Live Project (https://github.com/ivandavidov/minimal) that dream is a reality for me. \r\n\r\n![AwlsomeLinux](https://github.com/AwlsomeAlex/AwlsomeLinux/blob/master/AwlsomeLinux.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n## NEWS: **A Rewrite is needed...**\r\nWell as quickly as I created AwlsomeLinux, I didn't expect it to be this disorganized and cluddered, so I've decided to rewite AwlsomeLinux **COMPLETELY**, hoping to break away from any ties drawing me towards Minimal Linux Live as well, not due to it being a bad thing or anything, but it's just too complicated for what I want, so instead of simplifying the process, i'm remaking it. This is how it will be designed:\r\n* A Core Directory & Build Script (Makes Linux Kernel, Busybox and Glibc)\r\n* An Image Directory & Build Script (Gets Syslinux and Makes ISO Image)\r\n* An Overlay Directory & Buidl Script **[TBD]** (*Possible Idea:* Gets Overlay Scripts from seperate repository and compiles them.)\r\n\r\n## What is AwlsomeLinux?\r\nRight now, AwlsomeLinux is a minimal, almost installable, and text-based Linux Environment (Wouldn't call it a Distro yet...) which has the following features:\r\n* The Latest Long-Term-Support Linux Kernel (4.4.x)\r\n* The Latest Stable BusyBox (1.25.x Stable)\r\n* The Latest Glibc (2.24)\r\n\r\n**Extra Packages Such As:**\r\n* Links 2.13 (Text-Based Web Browser)\r\n* Dropbear 2016.74 (Shell SSH)\r\n* Nano 2.6.3 (Alternative Text Editor)\r\n\r\n## Contributors:\r\n* AwlsomeAlex (Creator of AwlsomeLinux)\r\n* Ivandavidov (Creator of Minimal Linux Live) [AwlsomeLinux is a Fork of it.]\r\n\r\n\r\n",
