<p>Creating a Linux Distributon Seemed to be an impossible task, where only the huge people like Debian or Fedora could make them, or the best you can do is remix Ubuntu and hope it contents that urge of making something. However, thanks to Ivandavidov's Minimal Linux Live Project (<a href="https://github.com/ivandavidov/minimal">https://github.com/ivandavidov/minimal</a>) that dream is a reality for me. </p>

<p>Welcome to AwlsomeLinux, a small embedded Linux Distribution that you can "Mostly" build yourself. This project started with my interest on how the Linux Kernel works, and how Tiny Core Linux worked, so I decided "Why not just build it?" Well, this was last year, and the <a href="https://github.com/ivandavidov/minimal">Minimal Linux Live Project</a>, the project AwlsomeLinux is forked on, was barely off its feet and my goal of a Linux Distribution was further than ever. However recently Ivandavidov put alot of work to the project, and I decided to fork it. AwlsomeLinux wasn't the first thing I had in mind however, the main reason I forked it was due to the project becoming too complex, so I merely simplified it. However I then got the idea "Why not add to it as well." I then implemented Nano and Ncurses, not too difficult, but wasn't 'entirely' accepted. Due to this, I then decided that I would start my own project, thus AwlsomeLinux (AwlsomeAlex Linux). Once this decision was made, I then simplified the scripts even more, to the point where the whole project was three scripts, one folder and one makefile, and after weeks of rewritting, I finally considered myself my own Linux Distribution. For here on out my main goals will be to add more packages, make AwlsomeLinux installable, make AwlsomeLinux self-hosted, and make AwlsomeLinux a GUI/TUI Interface.</p>
